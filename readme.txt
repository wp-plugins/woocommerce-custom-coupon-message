This plugin adds a meta box to the coupon edit screen where you can enter your custom message which will be displayed when the coupon is applied.

== Description ==

It's also possible to hide the default message from Woocommerce so that only your custom coupon message is displayed.
(the plugin uses inline CSS to hide the default Woocommerce message).

Take a look at the screenshots for the coupon edit screen with the plugin enabled and some examples.

The meta box was implemented using the technique described on this blog post:
